## ABOUT
This is a basic frontend web shop app that has its data stored localy. The idea just came about because i wanted to create a website from a figma design which i have found on the internet and created a website from that figma file. I didnt create a 
backend component for this beacause i didnt have enough data for it to make sense and this was just me testing out creating a website from someone else's design. Tried to make it as responsive as possible.
